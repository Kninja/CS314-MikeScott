# CS314-TestCases
Repository for test cases to the assignments of Mike Scott's homework assignments.
I will try my best to screen and run any test cases that are added.

Please commit your own test cases!!!

I will not be hosting any solutions to individual assignments, they are to be completed on your own. 
	See <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~scottm/cs314/Assignments/index.htm">Mike Scott's Assignment Guidelines</a>
