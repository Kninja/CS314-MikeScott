# CS314-TestCases
Repository for test cases to the assignments of Mike Scott's homework assignments.
I will try my best to screen and run any test cases that are added.

Please commit your own test cases!!!
"If you use one person's test cases, then contribute your own test cases the next week." - Mike

I will not be hosting any solutions to individual assignments, they are to be completed on your own.
See <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~scottm/cs314/Assignments/index.htm">Mike Scott's Assignment Guidelines</a>

Assignment 3 - The Name Surfer
"For this assignment you may not share your tests, but you can share your results when using different data files such as names2.txt." - Mike

For comparing result, I would recommend a  tool to compare text, such as <a href="https://www.diffchecker.com/">Diff Checker</a>

Assignment 2 - Math Matrix
"I encourage you to share you tests with others..." - Mike
